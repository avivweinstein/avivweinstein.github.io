# Maybe So. Maybe Not.
## Embracing Uncertainty. Lessons from a Chinese Parable

During today’s uncertain times, I often think of an old Chinese parable. It goes something like this:

—————————————————————————————————————————————
A farmer and his son had a beloved horse who helped the family earn a living. One day, the horse ran away and their neighbors exclaimed, “Your horse ran away, what terrible luck!” The farmer replied, “Maybe so, maybe not.”

A few days later, the horse returned home, leading a few wild horses back to the farm as well. The neighbors shouted out, “Your horse has returned, and brought several horses home with him. What great luck!” The farmer replied, “Maybe so, maybe not.”

Later that week, the farmer’s son was trying to break one of the horses and she threw him to the ground, breaking his leg. The neighbors cried, “Your son broke his leg, what terrible luck!” The farmer replied, “Maybe so, maybe not.”

A few weeks later, soldiers from the national army marched through town, recruiting all boys for the army. They did not take the farmer’s son, because he had a broken leg. The neighbors shouted, “Your boy is spared, what tremendous luck!” To which the farmer replied, “Maybe so, maybe not. We’ll see.”

The simple phrase, “Maybe so, maybe not” reminds us that life is unpredictable and that the future is often uncertain. We can’t always know how today’s actions are going to affect tomorrow.

At its core, this proverb is a reminder to stay open-minded and flexible. Instead of getting locked into a particular outcome or point of view, it encourages us to approach the future with a sense of openness.

This mindset can be particularly helpful when dealing with difficult or stressful situations. When we're facing a challenge or a crisis, it's easy to get caught up in our emotions and lose sight of the bigger picture. But, by reminding ourselves that the future is uncertain, we can take a step back and try to view the situation more objectively, allowing for cooler heads to prevail.

It gives us permission to take things one step at a time, and to trust that things will work out in the end.

By staying open-minded and flexible, we can navigate the ups and downs of life with greater ease and resilience. So the next time you're feeling uncertain or doubtful, remember this simple phrase, and see where it takes you.
